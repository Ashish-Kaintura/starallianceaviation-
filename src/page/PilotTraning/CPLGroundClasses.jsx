              CPL (Commercial Pilot License)—DGCA Guidelines & Process
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 font-sans mt-6 leading-relaxed text-justify">
              The Commercial Pilot License (CPL), issued by the Directorate
              General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), is an invaluable credential that
              signifies a professional pathway in aviation. The path to
              obtaining your CPL requires substantial flight training as well as
              substantial theoretical training during the CPL ground classes.
              <br />
              <br />
              The CPL ground classes are valuable and essential because they
              provide the candidates with the knowledge needed to perform well
              on Engel's DGCA examinations on air regulations, meteorology,
              navigation, and more. Star Alliance Aviation Academy provides
              student-oriented CPL ground classes with experienced instructors,
              and the goal is to give students a solid foundation on aviation
              theory, improve confidence, and pass the examinations
              successfully.
